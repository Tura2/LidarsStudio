## ðŸ›  Technologies
- **Kotlin / Android**, ViewBinding, Material Components
- **Firebase**: Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions

## ðŸ§© Potential Issues & Known Limitations
- **Network dependency** â€“ Since all data is stored in Firebase, lack of internet connection prevents booking or viewing updates.
- **Simultaneous bookings** â€“ If two customers try to book the same slot simultaneously, only the first request processed by Firestore will succeed.
- **Crash risk on malformed Firestore data** â€“ If a document is missing required fields (e.g., `service` or `date`), certain adapters may throw exceptions.
- **Gallery loading delay** â€“ Large images or slow connections may cause longer loading times despite Glide optimizations.
- **Email notifications** â€“ Relies on Firebase Functions; if these fail (e.g., due to quota limits), managers may not get tattoo request emails.
